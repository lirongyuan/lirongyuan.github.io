      <description>About Me Hi, I am Lirong Yuan. I graduated from Purdue University in May 2014 with a double major in mathematics and computer science. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a software engineer at Google. My current team, Emerging Toolchains, strives to support emerging hardware platforms being developed for Google&amp;rsquo;s production data centers. I enjoy reading, watching movies, and hiking during my free time.</description>

      <description>Research Roots of polynomials with random integer coefficients It is natural to use polynomials with integer coefficients for examples and exercises in an algebra course. However, not all such polynomials have all real roots. We ask a question: what is the probability that a random polynomial with integer coefficients has all real roots? We use some tools from probability theory and complex analysis to reduce the problem to studying the roots of random polynomials with real-valued coefficients instead.</description>

      <description>Work Iâ€™m currently working on supporting remote debugging under a process-level virtualization system.
Open Source Contributions While working on supporting sanitizers (ASan, HWASan, TSan, MSan, and UBSan), profile-guided optimization (PGO), and QEMU for arm toolchain, I had the opportunity to contribute to many open source projects:
LLVM Update macro for OFF_T so that sanitizer works on AARCH64 Fix memory leak in GetGDBServerRegisterInfoXMLAndProcess QEMU linux-user: Add AT_EXECFN auxval linux-user: Update TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE for aarch64 gdbstub: add support to Xfer:auxv:read: packet GLIBC locale: align _nl_C_LC_CTYPE_class and _nl_C_LC_CTYPE_class32 arrays to uint16_t and uint32_t respectively </description>
